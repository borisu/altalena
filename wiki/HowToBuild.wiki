#summary Development environment setup guidelines.

= Introduction =

 The project was compiled and on Vista and Windows 7 machines. Using it windows versions prior to Vista is impossible due to extensive usage of TLS storage by logging infrastructure and KentCSP++ kernel. One may read more on the topic [http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=187 here]. Though the OS and IDE is proprietary, the project itself uses only open source third party libraries.

Please report any problem to [mailto:borisusun@gmail.com borisusun], if you are experiencing problems compiling the project on other windows version, or you are interested to port it to a different platform.


*I know that currently setting up an development environment requires a lot of effort. the main reason for that is a lot of dependencies that every open source project brings with it :(. Any suggestion on how to simplify building process will be warmly accepted*

= Dependencies =

The library depends on 

 # [http://www.boostpro.com/boost_1_34_1_setup.exe boost 1.34.1] - Pre-built libraries are available to download. Download it,build, and update your IDE include and library options.

These are pretty big dependencies well over 100Mb in complete installation each. Obviously I couldn't include them into subversion tree. 

Other project dependencies:-
 # [http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/c++csp/doc/installation.html C++CSP]
 # [http://www.lua.org lua]
 # [http://www.resiprocate.org resiprocate 1.4.1]
 # [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/JSON_Spirit.aspx json spirit]
 # [http://www.linphone.org/index.php/eng/code_review/mediastreamer2 mediastreamer2]
 # [http://www.live555.com/ live555]
 # [http://www.unimrcp.org/ unimrcp]

are either included into subversion tree completely or by means of subversion externals.

= Setup =

 * Checkout altalena code in '<project root>\altalena' - see instructions [http://code.google.com/p/altalena/source/checkout here]. Write to administrator if you want to become a member of development team. 

 * Run "configure.bat" ensure that it prints SUCCESS after run.

 * Open <root project>\solutions\altalena_all\altalena_all.sln.

 * In Linker\General Change "Link Library Dependencies" option in libmsilbc, mediastreamer2, ortp projects to "No".

 * build unimrcp-deps first

 * build 'iw_setup' project 



=Start= 

You can use dummy csharpio for compiliing .NET files or iw_lualib. 

For both you will have to configure the solution directory 

Configuration file is located in '<project root>\iw_run\conf.json'. Test script is located in '<project root>\altalena\iw_run\scripts\myscript.lua'. Inspect the files and change them accordingly to your environment.

All files needed to run are copied to '<project root>\solutions\altalena_all\<compile configuration>' directory. 

 
Configure your iw_lualib project to use these files for debugging.

Should look something like this:-
